# Proposal Lifecycle
The 1inch Network DAO governance process takes place in the governance forum at [gov.1inch.io](https://gov.1inch.io/). Proposals are formally ratified through the 1inch Improvement Proposal (1IPs). There are no requirements for participating in the 1inch Network DAO discussion. Anyone can sign up for the 1inch Governance forum, or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/1inch), and engage in the conversation. 

## Phase 1: Discussion
The purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the broader 1inch community. Each unique idea should have its own thread so that the conversation can stay on topic, it should be as narrowly focused as possible. Anyone can participate in this phase of governance, and it occurs entirely off-chain. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.

**Duration:** Open-Ended

## Phase 2: 1IP Formalization
Phase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an 1IP that includes all of the criteria specified in the [1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) Template](#1inch-Improvement-Proposal-(1IP)-Template). It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. It is a requirement that a single 1IP contains a single proposal. All 1IPs must have the following components (refer to the template for a detailed breakdown):
* **Simple Summary**
* **Abstract**
* **Motivation**
* **Specification** 
* **Rationale**
* **Considerations**


The forum is the formal arena to debate the merits of each 1IP. Once the 1IP has been drafted, the author must post it on the 1inch governance forum and use the tag: Phase-2. 

While the 1IP is in a draft state, the 1IP author is free to make modifications to the proposal based on feedback from the community's review.

**Duration**: Open-Ended

## Phase 3: 1IP Temperature Check

At any point during Phase-2, the author may finalize the 1IP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must change the tag of the forum post to Phase-3, and add a forum poll to gauge the community’s sentiment. 

1IPs should only be progressed to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments and believes the 1IP is prepared for incorporation.
Phase-3 represents the final proposal. Other than correcting errata, 1IPs in Phase 3 may not be edited.

The poll must be open for 5 days and only have the following options: 
* (Yes) In favor of this proposal.
* (No) Against this proposal.

Note: This process is irreversible, i.e., an author may not revert an 1IP back to Stage-2 if it fails the temperature check vote.

**Duration:** Exactly 5 days

## Phase 4: Snapshot Vote

All 1IPs are confirmed, or rejected, by the 1inch Network DAO via an off-chain [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth) vote. The Snapshot vote must link to the results of the successful Phase-2 forum poll and include the full text of the finalized 1IP. Anyone can initiate the Snapshot vote as long as all requirements of Phase-2 were met (it does not have to be the 1IP author).

The Snapshot voting period must last exactly seven days. During this period, addresses with voting power may vote for or against the proposal using the same two voting options as the Phase-2 poll:
* (Yes) In favor of this proposal.
* (No) Against this proposal.

[Voting Weight](#Voting-Weight) is proportional to the amount of governance tokens held by, or delegated to, an address. To prevent griefing of the 1inch governance process, a minimum of 25,000 Voting Weight is required to create a Snapshot vote (e.g., 25,000 st1INCH or 125,000 v1INCH).

In order for a vote to be considered successful, both of the following must be met:
* A minimum quorum of 10 million weighted votes must be cast.
* A majority of the votes must be (Yes) I am in favor of this proposal.

See [Voting Process](#Voting-Process) for a detailed description of how Voting Weight is calculated and how Vote Delegation works.

**Duration:** Exactly 7 days

## Phase 5: Implementation
After the Snapshot voting period has concluded, the results will be posted on [1IPs section](#1IPs) of the governance documentation site. If the proposal has passed, it will move from the Active to Passed category. Unsuccessful proposals will move to Not-Passed. 

[SafeSnap](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality) allows for on-chain execution of the off-chain Snapshot vote by using the [reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. Reality.eth’s bonded escalation period lasts at least 72 hours (this period is reset if the resolution is challenged). The SafeSnap process officially concludes once a full 72 hour escalation period has elapsed without challenge.

There is an additional 72 hour period of time between the SafeSnap resolution and the incorporation of said 1IP into the protocol -- this is known as the Timelock. During the Timelock period, the [1inch Network DAO Treasury](#1inch-Network-DAO-Treasury) multisig owners will have the ability to veto malicious transactions in a 7-of-12 fashion.

For more involved 1IPs, the implementation will vary on a case-by-case basis.

**Duration:** 6 days, minimum

# Voting Process

## Voting Weight
1inch Protocol is controlled by the 1inch governance tokens. To ensure that the individuals with direct control over the protocol have a vested interest in its long term success, while also limiting the power of backers and core contributors, different voting weights were assigned to each class of governance token:

* **1INCH:** The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals. It must first be staked.
* **st1INCH:** This is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%.
* **v1INCH:** This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors, and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

## Staking
1INCH must be [staked](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance) in the governance contract to participate in voting. Staking is an on-chain event in which the user temporarily locks their 1INCH up and receives non-transferable st1INCH. At any point the user may reverse the process by using the [Unstake token](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance?action=unstake) UI.

## Vote Delegation
Holders of the 1inch governance tokens may delegate their Voting Weight to an address of their choice. Those who choose to delegate their voting rights to another address are known as Delegators, while those who receive delegation are known as delegatees. 

Anybody can participate in 1inch DAO governance if their address has received delegation, even if the address of the delegatee holds no governernance tokens. 

1inch governance token holders may choose to delegate their voting powers using the governance UI, or by interacting directly with the Snapshot delegation smart contract.

## Supported Networks
Currently, 1inch DAO voting uses governance token balances and delegations on the Ethereum mainnet and Binance Smart Chain.

## 1INCH Token
1INCH is the governance and utility token of the 1inch Network.

# 1inch Network DAO Treasury
The 1inch Network DAO Treasury is the pool of funds under the direct domain and ownership of the community. 

All protocol revenues are directed to the Treasury and referral rewards.

## DAO Treasury 
The 1inch Network DAO Treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/balances) smart contract wallet with multi-signature (multisig) functionality on the Ethereum mainnet. 12 multisig owners have initially been selected by the 1inch Foundation from the core contributor team and other well-known projects, such as [Tornado Cash](https://tornado.cash/), [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), [Opium](https://opium.network/), [NEAR protocol](https://near.org/), and [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), to name a few. These signers are able to veto malicious transactions in a 7 of 12 fashion. 

## Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap
Snapshot allows for gasless voting. SafeSnap is a Snapshot module that allows for on-chain execution of off-chain voting. The combination of these tools gives the DAO’s votes direct control over the Gnosis Safe that holds the Treasury funds.

## Revenue stream
The 1inch Pathfinder algorithm always provides users the most current and best possible prices on a swap. However, the swap price sometimes moves between the time of the quote and the time that the transaction is mined — resulting in a Swap Surplus. 

Funds are collected from the Swap Surplus on all chains. A portion of these funds are paid out to the referral program on the chain the swaps were performed. The remainder are sent to the Ethereum mainnet, swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury. 

Governance participants are able to control the revenue split of the [Aggregation protocol](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance/aggregation?action=stake) and [Liquidity protocol](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance?action=stake) by voting with Instant Governance.

# Instant Governance
Instant Governance is a feature that allows the community to vote for specific protocol settings. The Aggregation Protocol and Liquidity Protocol each have their own Instant Governance module.

## Aggregation Protocol Instant Governance
The [Aggregation Protocol Instant Governance](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance/aggregation?action=stake) module allows community members to vote on how the Swap Surplus revenue stream is split between the Treasury and the referrers. 

## Liquidity Protocol Instant Governance
The [Liquidity Protocol Instant Governance](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/governance) module allows the community to vote directly on major Liquidity Protocol parameters: the price impact fee, the swap fee, the Treasury  accrual rate, the referral reward, and the decay period. 

There are two levels of Liquidity Protocol Instance Governance:

* **Pool governance** only allows for the configuration of parameters specific to each pool. These include the swap fee, the price impact fee and the decay period.

* **Factory governance** is responsible for parameters shared by all pools. These include the default swap fee, the default price impact fee, the default decay period, the referral reward and the Treasury accrual rate.

### Decay period
The decay period is a unique feature that protects traders from front-running attacks and prevents arbitrage traders from easily extracting value from pools. Longer decay periods lead to a wider price spread in the pool after trades. 1INCH stakers can set a decay period between 15 seconds and 1 hour.

### Referral reward
This reward is a part of the swap fee and the price impact fee which will be dedicated to referrers (dApps and wallets that attract users and trading volume). Referrers can subsequently claim their share of 1INCH tokens from all pools in one gas-efficient claim transaction.

### Treasury accrual rate
All protocol revenue not sent to the referrers is instead sent to the Treasury.

# 1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) Template

## Title
Title should reflect the content of the 1IP. 

For the forum post, prefix “[1IP-#]” to the title (replace # with the lowest available proposal number) and set the tag on the post to Phase-2. 

## Simple Summary
A brief, high-level summary of what changes are being suggested. Summary should be a single sentence, or a bulleted list.

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the motivation and specification sections. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this 1IP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the 1inch Network or protocols? What use cases does this 1IP address?

## Specification 
The specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, or change, at a technical level. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for implementation by a development team.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered, and explain why the proposed specification provides the most amount of net benefit.

## Considerations
All 1IPs must contain a section that discusses the security and governance implications/considerations of the proposal.

Security specific implications/considerations include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, drawbacks, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed, etc.

Governance specific implications/considerations include impact on revenue stream, cost to treasury, voting process, staking, tokenomics, etc.

# 1IPs
This section tracks all 1IPs that have made it to Phase 3 of the Proposal Lifecycle. 

## Active
All 1IPs that are currently in the Phase 3 voting process:

## Passed
All 1IPs that have successfully passed the Phase 3 vote. These 1IPs have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented:

## Not-Passed
All 1IPs that did not pass the Phase 3 vote. These 1IPs did not meet the minimum quorum, and/or a majority of the voting weight was opposed to the change. 

# Glossary

### 1INCH
An ERC-20 token that is used to participate in the 1inch DAO governance process.
* **st1INCH:** An ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked with the 1inch protocol.
* **v1INCH:** An ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are not yet fully-vested and have reduced voting weight (20%) compared to st1INCH.

### 1IP
1inch Improvement Proposal, 1IP, is the formalization of a proposal. 

### DAO
A decentralized autonomous organization.

### Delegation
st1INCH and v1INCH holders can delegate their voting rights to any address. Delegation does not lock the tokens, and the delegator has the power to revoke this delegation at any time. Vote delegation is an on-chain event.
* **Delegator:** The governance token holder that has delegated their voting power to another address.
* **Delegatee:** The address that has been delegated voting power from any number of delegators.

### Docusaurus
The tool used to build 1inch DAO’s documentation site. Docusaurus is similar to GitBook, however Docusaurus has an unencumbered free-use MIT license.

### Off-chain
An event that does not occur on the blockchain. Off-chain events are gasless. 

### On-chain
An event that is recorded and verified by the blockchain. All on-chain transactions incur fees paid to miners/validators.

### Quorum
In order for a snapshot vote to pass, it must achieve a quorum of 10 million 1INCH votes. The purpose of the quorum is to ensure adequate voter participation for all proposals passed.

### Snapshot
Snapshot is the protocol that allows users to vote on proposals in a gasless fashion.

### Staking contract
The smart-contract that governance participants use to stake their 1INCH.

### Swap Surplus
The Swap Surplus is generated by swap transactions when the executed price is slightly better than the price quoted.

### Timelock
All governance actions passed with the voting process will have a time delay of 72 hours before they are incorporated. This applies to funds spent from the DAO Treasury, and any change to the 1inch Protocol’s smart contracts. 

### Voting 
Voting is the formal process of passing or failing 1IPs. Voting is done through Snapshot — gasless off-chain voting using the on-chain balances of st1INCH and v1INCH.

### Voting Period
All Snapshot votes will have a voting period of seven days for 1inch DAO members to cast their vote.
