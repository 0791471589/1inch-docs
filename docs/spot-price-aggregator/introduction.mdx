# Spot Price Aggregator

The 1inch spot price aggregator is a set of smart contracts that extract price data for tokens traded on DEXes from the blockchain. To avoid price manipulations within a transaction, the spot price aggregator should ONLY be used off-chain. DO NOT use it on-chain. For off-chain usage see [Examples](#examples) section below.
